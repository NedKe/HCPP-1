                                acquired
                                for the first time in 2006 and the club was at the forefront of a state-of-the-art
                                ultralight
                                aircraft.
                                Since 2013, it has been the club's primary school flight and it is much appreciated by
                                students.

                            <p>
                                Klubbens Skylane v.5 is a high-winged ultra-light aircraft of traditional design.
                                The plane is constructed entirely in composite with a rescue parachute and integrated
                                wing
                                tanks
                                of
                                47 liters each, ie. a total of 94 liters.
                                Skylanen has steering wheel steering that allows easy entry and exit, which, especially
                                at
                                sea,
                                is
                                positive.The flap is electric and very efficient, which allows landings on short fields.
                                The trim is also electric.The plane has toe tip brakes on both sides and a free-swinging
                                nose
                                wheel that allows very narrow turns, for example on the track. Skylanen is very easy to
                                fly
                                and
                                has nice stable properties.The club's Skylane has an 80hp Rotax engine that gives it a
                                cruise
                                speed
                                of 97 kt at 4800 rpm and then the fuel consumption is about 14 liters / hour

                                The Skylan is also supplemented with aluminum floats of the Fillinger type and can
                                be a very practical seaplane with a large easily accessible cargo space. The club's
                                Skylane
                                is
                                also equipped with water-borne carburetor preheating and an oil thermostat which leads
