                    <p>
                        Dynamic is a beautiful, beautiful aircraft that provides a wonderful flying experience!
                        There are 2 Dynamic in the club and SUF has owned more over the years.Dynamic was acquired
                        for the first time in 2006 and the club was at the forefront of a state-of-the-art ultralight
                        aircraft.
                        Since 2013, it has been the club's primary school flight and it is much appreciated by students.
                        WT9 Dynamic is a state-of-the-art high-performance aircraft built from carbon fiber, fiberglass
                        and
                        Kevlar.The engine is a Rotax 912 ULS with an output of 100 hp. The aircraft's cruising speed is
                        about 120
                        kts and Vne is about 160 kts.The instrumentation is of the glass cockpit type. The screen on the
                        master side is a Dynon D100 with altimeter, speedometer, variometer, ball, g-meter, gyro
                        compass,
                        gyro horizon, clock and timer.To the right is a Dynon D120 with, in addition to normal engine
                        instruments, exhaust temperature, fuel gauge, fuel consumption gauge (fuel flow with calculation
                        of
                        remaining time and consumption per hour), external temperature and intake pressure. It is
                        possible
                        to switch instrumentation between the two sides and also use the split-screen function for other
                        distribution of the instruments. Our Dynamic are also equipped with a portable GPS - EKP IV,
                        with 7 ‚Äùscreen based on Jeppesen database, and 2-axis autopilot.

                    <h2>Skylane</h2>
                    <p>
                        Klubbens Skylane v.5 is a high-winged ultra-light aircraft of traditional design.
                        The plane is constructed entirely in composite with a rescue parachute and integrated wing tanks
                        of
                        47 liters each, ie. a total of 94 liters.
                        Skylanen has steering wheel steering that allows easy entry and exit, which, especially at sea,
                        is
                        positive.The flap is electric and very efficient, which allows landings on short fields.
                        The trim is also electric.The plane has toe tip brakes on both sides and a free-swinging nose
                        wheel that allows very narrow turns, for example on the track. Skylanen is very easy to fly and
                        has nice stable properties.The club's Skylane has an 80hp Rotax engine that gives it a cruise
                        speed
                        of 97 kt at 4800 rpm and then the fuel consumption is about 14 liters / hour

                    <h2>Skylane as seaplane</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Skylan is also supplemented with aluminum floats of the Fillinger type and can
                        be a very practical seaplane with a large easily accessible cargo space. The club's Skylane is
                        also equipped with water-borne carburetor preheating and an oil thermostat which leads to faster
                        heating of the engine and a more even oil temperature.
