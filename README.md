# Swedish Ultraflyers
### Introduction
This Swedish Ultraflyers (SUF) website is about a flight club in Frölunda close to Stockholm that is specialized in ultralight planes (UL). I am an active member of the club and have a great passion for flying airplanes. Currently, the club has a website in the Swedish language (https://www.frolundaflygfalt.se/) and does not have the best design and interface as you can see snapshots of different pages of the site in ***figure 1***. People who are looking for the best flight school or flight club may not know Swedish. Some people visit Stockholm during summertime, and they want to enjoy the scenery flying over the Baltic sea and archipelago. Also, some travelers on light planes to Frölunda landing at the club's airport. Therefore, I decided to make a website in the English language with a better design for the club.

 The website provides information about the club, its school, the prices, and the type of ultralight planes that the club owns. This website gives the possibility to sign up for a test flight and to submit an interest application for the pilot certificate programs. Additionally, the website provides contact information and social media networks to the users.The following are users of the website:
- People interested to experience flying on an ultralight plane
- The pilots who already have a certificate and want to become a member and use the facilities or airplanes at the Swedish Ultraflyers club. 
- People who want to obtain a UL certificate or want to attend the theory program.

### Features

##### The navigation bar
  - A fixed navigation bar is positioned on the right side of the page with a 4% distance from the top, see ***figure 3 left***. This is because I liked it this way rather than sticking the navbar to the top for medium and large screen sizes. The navbar sticks to this position when the user scrolls the page. 
  - The navigation bar position moves to top (0%) above the logo and sticks there at screen sizes 620px and down when scrolling up, see ***figure 3 right***. 
   - The navigation menu has four links to pages Home, About, Planes, and Certificate.
   - The logo in the header and footer also links to the Homepage.

##### The Header

The header has a logo of the flight club, a navigation bar, and a background picture, see ***figure 4 left***. The logo is the club name and sits at the top left of the header. The background image shows an ultralight plane in the air giving the clue on what the site is about. On ***About*** page, see ***figure 4 right*** the header has a  feature presenting a video on a blank background that is muted and is on autoplay.

##### Ceritificate 
- The first section is an introduction to flight training procedures followed by information about prices for users who want to become a club member, see ***figure 7 left***. 

- The second section provides prices to book different plane types followed by training costs for those who want to start flight training at the club's school, see ***figure 7 middle***. 

- Finally, the third section of the certificate page is a ***form*** where the user can apply to the school training programs, see ***figure 7 right***. The form gives the users an option to choose what they want to apply for and pick up a start date. The user should be above 18 years old to fly with an instructor and provides information on the age so that the club can plan on what program they can start based on the user's age. If the user already has the medical certificate and student permit, which are required to fly with an instructor, they can also upload the files in this form.

A page with a thank you message pops up when the ***Lets Fly***  or ***Submit your application*** buttons in ***homepage*** and page ***Certificate***, respectively, are pressed. This page gives a  confirmation to users that the buttons work and the form is submitted, see ***figure 8 top***.

### Test work
-Checked the sign up form in homepage and application form in page certificate so that all the validations work. Also controled the links to terms and conditions and confirmation page after submission open in a new tab.
- Checked that all the external links open in new tab.
- checked that the site works properly in safari and google chrome.
- Used Chrome DevTools to check out the HTML and its related properties in CSS to improve my code and CSS. Using DevTools I also checked different screen sizes to make the webpage responsive. Later I checked the website on real GlaxyS9, iphone11, desktop screen and 13-inch macbookpro screen.  In addition I used console and fixed couple of errors related to placeholder that I set for date and time input. The placeholder is simply unnecessary for date and time input by removing it the error in console disappears. 
- The contrast checker was used to make sure that the contrast between foreground and background is optimized for visually impaired individuals.

### Bugs
#### Reseolved issues
- Render blocking stylesheet (Allison) by changing the link taken from google font with:
```
<link media="print" onload="this.onload=null;this.removeAttribute('media');"
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Allison" rel="stylesheet">
```
- The order of submit and terms elements and borders touching for mobile version, the position is swtiched
- The select element in form in certificate page did not get the style when opened in Safari. This is fixed by adding webkit to select in style sheet:
```
select {
    -webkit-appearance: initial;
}
```

### Validation 
- The HTML and CSS code is validated by W3C and jogsaw tool, respectively, and no errors are detected on the final version of all the webpages.
- The accesibility is controlled by lighthouse for both mobile and desktop and the reports are as follow:

 - The accessibility for users with impairments is checked by WAVE evaluation tools (https://wave.webaim.org/), and the report shows no error. There is an alert when evaluating the page "About" that is related to the video. Since there is only music without words on the video the caption and transcript addition is skipped therefore the alerts can be ignored.
