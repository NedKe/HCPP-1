### Test work
-Checked the sign up form inhomepage and application form in page certificate so that all the validations work. Also when click terms and conditions or on submit button it links the user to terms and conditions and thank you page, respectivly.
- Checked that all the external links open in new tab.
- checked that the site works properly in safari and google chrome.
-Used Chrome DevTools to check out the HTML and its related properties in CSS to improve my code and CSS. Using DevTools I also checked different screen sizes to make the webpage responsive. Later I checked the website on real GlaxyS9, iphone11, desktop screen and 13-inch macbookpro screen.  In addition I used console and fixed couple of errors related to placeholder that I set for date and time input. The placeholder is simply unnecessary for date and time input by removing it the error in console disappears.

### Bugs
#### Reseolved issues
- Render blocking stylesheet (Allison) by changing the link taken from google font with:
```
<link media="print" onload="this.onload=null;this.removeAttribute('media');"
        href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Allison" rel="stylesheet">
```
- The order of submit and terms elements and borders touching for mobile version, the position is swtiched
- The select element in form in certificate page did not get the style when opened in Safari. This is fixed by adding webkit to select in style sheet:
```
select {
    -webkit-appearance: initial;
}
```

### Validation 
- The HTML and CSS code is validated by W3C and jogsaw tool, respectively, and no errors are detected on the final version of all the webpages.

 - The accessibility for users with impairments is checked by WAVE evaluation tools (https://wave.webaim.org/), and the report shows no error. There is an alert when evaluating the page "About" that is related to the video. Since there is only music without words on the video the caption and transcript addition is skipped therefore the alerts can be ignored.
