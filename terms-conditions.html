                <p>These organizations may link to our home page, to publications or to other Website information so
                    long as

                    approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and (c) fits within the context of
                    the
                    linking party’s site.</p>

                    any
                    negative records with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink compensates the
                    absence of Swedish Ultraflyer; and (d) the link is in the context of general resource information.
                </p>

                <p>These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive;
                    (b)
                    does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the linking party and its products or
                    services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party’s site.</p>
