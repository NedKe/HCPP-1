                    <h2>About Swedish Ultraflyers (SUF) club</h2>
                    <p>
                        Swedish Ultraflyers (SUF) was formed in 1984 to create an ultra-light flying club in Upplands
                        Väsby
                        with Einar Edland and Gunnar Rydergren at the helm. Gunnar was chairman and Einar technical
                        manager.
                        We looked at Weedhopper, Quicksilver etc., but when KG Knutsson opened an agency for Teratorn
                        Tierra II,
                        we chose Tierran. To finance the aircraft, we needed 10 people who were willing to personally
                        guarantee the
                        loan of SEK 110,000, which the kit cost then. We had to borrow premises from one of the members
                        where we
                        could assemble our Tierra, SE-YHG. We probably built the cart 3 times before everything was
                        ready.
                        We were eager and made many mistakes due to the fact that we did not read the instructions
                        carefully enough,
                        which meant that we missed the seat belts which was one of the first steps to assemble. To
                        assemble these,
                        we had to disassemble the entire aircraft. We probably built the cart 3 times before everything
                        was ready.
                        We dragged Tierran down to the frozen lake Norrviken, mounted wings and the test pilot /
                        salesman,
                        Krister Larsson (now Krister Segerdahl) sat down behind the wheel (it is a steering wheel in
                        Tierran) and
                        did a successful test flight. First up by the club members was Einar, as he was the only one
                        with a flight certificate.
                        It was a lot of flying for Einar, because everyone wanted a test drive. The question was where
                        we would place the business
                        when the ice was gone. Einar landed on the snow (we had skis) at Frölunda farm, Kungsängen and
                        knocked on the door of
                        Claes af Ugglas and asked if we could be at their airport. After some time of reflection, we had
                        to rent two hangar
                        places, an oil shed, and a small bucket as a clubhouse and farmer's tank. Gunnar fixed so we got
                        a phone call.
                        The following year we had two Tierra and luckily it was then that we rented two hangar
                        places.After a few years, we moved into a real clubhouse that was sponsored by "Skåningarna" and
                        we fixed electricity, we dug a well and sent in water samples that were approved, and arranged
                        drains in the closed system. We rented a larger farm tank from Hjelmco Oil, which is our main
                        supplier of aviation soup. In 2000, we built an extra hangar and laid cement slabs in front of
                        the hangars.
                        In 1986 we were hit by a long flight ban when it turned out that the wings could not withstand
                        the number
                        of "G" promised. KG Knutsson had to develop new wings from Poland that withstood what they were
                        supposed to.
                        After a year of downtime and loyal members, we were able to fly our machines again, which
                        changed its name to Akka.
                        All in all, we flew more than 2000 hours with our Tierra / Akka. Another problem with the
                        aircraft type was that they
                        had Rotax 532 two-stroke engines, which caused a lot of trouble and caused many landings, but
                        due to low stable speed
                        no major injuries occurred. We reckoned that for every fly hour we had to screw in two. Later
                        came the Rotax 582 and
                        the situation improved somewhat. The Akka aircraft was actually a good aircraft, if one ignores
                        the engine problems.
                        In total we had four different Akkor in our club.In 1991, Einar bought a Cuby II, SE-YLM with a
                        Rotax 503 of 50 hp which he typed into Sweden. It was a big step from Akka to Cuby II when the
                        Cuby looked like a "real plane" and the comments when you went around with the machine were that
                        "that is not ultra light". Einar had the Swedish agency at Cuby and also offered it with Rotax
                        912, a 4-stroke engine of 80 hp! The club took on this concept and our first Cuby II was SE-YLO
                        which has served us since 1992. After an accident in 1994, the machine was rebuilt into EuroCub
                        Mk.1. In 2000, SE-YLO was sold to Rolf Lewander, who at the time of writing is chairman of
                        Swedish Ultraflyers. The club still has access to "Ludvig Olle".
                        In 1995, EuroCub number 2, SE-YSG, was bought, which tragically completely crashed in 1997 and
                        one member died.
                        The reason was that the pilot had acute medical problems while flying. At the time of writing,
                        the club has three
                        EuroCubes SE-YTS, SE-YUS and SE-YVV, of which the latter will be on floats in the summer.
                        In 1999, some co-owners decided that we would go together and buy a EuroCub, SE-YUL, which would
                        be on floats.
                        A total of seven shares were sold, of which the club bought one. The belief in the club that
                        this with floats would work
                        was small, but after two years of sea flying without major incidents it was decided that "YULLE"
                        would be sold and a
                        new machine bought, SE-YVV, primarily for sea flying with Rotax 912 S of 95 hp.
